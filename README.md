# Project Discord (Landing Page)

Project of a landing page for Discord, made with the aim of practicing CSS3 concepts studied during the CSS3 Web Developer course by DigitalInnovationOne.

This is an improved and more advanced version compared to the initially proposed project, and it is also responsive. It is a static page, made only with HTML and CSS. A few lines of JavaScript were used just to enable the display of the menu on mobile devices.

During the decoding of this project, some concepts from the SMACSS (architecture) and BEM (nomenclature) standards were applied for the organization of style sheets.
