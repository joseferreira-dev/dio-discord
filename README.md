# Project Discord (Landing Page)

Design of a landing page for Discord, made with the aim of practicing the concepts studied during the CSS3 Web Developer course by DigitalInnovationOne.

The original project was a clone of the current Discord platform homepage, I chose to make a different version of the project. It is a static page, made only with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

During the decoding of this project, some concepts from the SMACSS (architecture) and BEM (nomenclature) standards were applied to the organization of stylesheets.
